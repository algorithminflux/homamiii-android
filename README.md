# HomamiiiAndroid

## About

A useful app that displays the creatures' stats from the original 1999 3DO game [Heroes of Might and Magic III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_III).

## Features

- Main menu consists of every creature within the game, sorted by army (e.g. Rampart, Fortress, etc)
- Tapping on a creature will open the creature's details page
 
## Installation

Navigate to this project's `app` directory, and download the `.apk` file located in there (i.e. `homamiii-android_yyyy-mm-ddThhmm.apk`. Next, you'll want to move this APK file to your Android device. There are many apps out there that allow you to transfer files over the LAN, but the simplest method would perhaps be to use a micro USB cable to plug your device to your computer.

## Notes

Please leave comments and/or feedback with any improvements for this app.

Enjoy!
